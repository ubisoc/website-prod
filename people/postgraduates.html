                <p>
                    Post Graduate students are a vital part of the Islamic Society community at the University of Birmingham. We’ve really jumped to the forefront in terms of Post Graduate Engagement over the last year with the introduction of our Post Graduate Officer role
                    on our Committee and Post Graduate Specific Events.
                </p>
            </header>

            <p>
                We are looking to run even more events this year for Post Graduate including our very exciting Post Graduate Freshers Week events! Look out for them in the near future. If you have any ideas or questions, please contact our Post Graduate Officer:
                <strong>Sohail Hussain (<a href="mailto:sohail.hussain@ubisoc.co.uk">sohail.hussain@ubisoc.co.uk</a>)</strong>.
            </p>

                "The Islamic society in the University of Birmingham (UBISOC) have always strived to help the Muslims by providing them with the prayer facilities, iftaar and every support they can do for students, staff and the community in Birmingham."

                <h3>Postgraduate Dinner</h3>
                <p>
                    We held a free Post Graduate Dinner in November last year. It was an extremely successful social event where around 70 Post Graduates came, socialised, networked and generally enjoyed themselves in a fun and lively atmosphere.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "It was a great event. I think for the first time in Birmingham I found myself within the folks I belong. So definitely that was an event to remember and hope ISOC come up with other such events in future"

                <p>
                    The Islamic Society hosted an Academic Skills Workshop in February 2017 focused on teaching Post Graduate (especially International Students) the UK Academic skills to enable them to best write their dissertations and essays. Hosted by Dr Hakeem Yusuf,
                    a lecturer in Law at the University of Birmingham, it was a very informative event with around 40 attendees.

                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "It was quite nice, getting together with many brothers was a good opportunity to meet them. And families also have the chance to meet. The food was great. I had a delightful time. We continued to get together occasionally with some brothers after this
                    night."
