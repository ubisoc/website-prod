                <p>
                    The University of Birmingham Islamic Society has a large and extremely hardworking committee dedicated to serving every Muslim student on campus.
                </p>

            <p>
                We have around <strong>20 positions</strong> with different positions split into teams concerning particular areas of the Islamic Society such as marketing. Each year, we elect a new committee for the following academic year at March during
                our <strong>Annual General Meeting</strong>. Anyone is free to run for a position so feel free to join our amazing committee by running for a role at our <strong>next AGM in March 2018</strong>.
            </p>

            The fact that youâ€™re checking out this page indicates that youâ€™re looking for a little more information on the committee and our roles so Iâ€™ll try and elaborate on what exactly I do.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a Co-President, I, along with the other Co-President Nimco Mumin, am responsible for overseeing and taking care of the whole Islamic Society. We make sure that the Islamic Society is heading in the right direction and is serving our members in the
            most effective way possible. I deal with external relations (such as external companies and the University management) and regularly hold meetings to discuss collaborations and develop relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our committee is generally very open and welcoming so you are encouraged to speak to anyone but if youâ€™d like to speak to me, Iâ€™m more than happy to offer whatever help I can. I look forward to speaking to you and I hope you have a great time at the University
            of Birmingham and with the Islamic Society!

            the final call as to whether such arrangements are financially feasible. This is to make sure that any finance given to us from our members or friends is taken great care of.
        </p>

            Our committee members are very friendly and wouldnâ€™t mind answering any questions that you have in mind about our society. Same goes with me, I would be happy to help with anything that I can. And if you are student who plans on studying here at the University
