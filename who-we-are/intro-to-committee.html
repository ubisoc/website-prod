                            Hi, my name is Aaquib Naved and I’m one of the Co-Presidents of the Islamic Society for the academic year 2017/18. I am a third year Computer Science student with a love for history and nature.

                            As a Co-President, I, along with the other Co-President Nimco Mumin, am responsible for overseeing and taking care of the whole Islamic Society. We make sure that the Islamic Society is heading in the right direction and is serving our members in the
                            most effective way possible. I deal with external relations (such as external companies and the University management) and regularly hold meetings to discuss collaborations and develop relationships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our committee is generally very open and welcoming so you are encouraged to speak to anyone but if you’d like to speak to me, I’m more than happy to offer whatever help I can. I look forward to speaking to you and I hope you have a great time at the University
                            of Birmingham and with the Islamic Society!

                        <p>
                            Being the treasurer, I am the person in charge of the finance of the whole Islamic Society. I make sure that the money is used to benefit our members in a responsible way. When the committee plans on holding future events, I am the one who tends to make
                            the final call as to whether such arrangements are financially feasible. This is to make sure that any finance given to us from our members or friends is taken great care of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our committee members are very friendly and wouldn’t mind answering any questions that you have in mind about our society. Same goes with me, I would be happy to help with anything that I can. And if you are student who plans on studying here at the University
                            of Birmingham, I hope you’ll enjoy your studies here and I’ll look forward to meeting you.

                            program activities designed to assist students in making critical transitions, develop their academic plans, connect with other students, and engage with learning communities. I, as does everyone on the committee, work closely with the Marketing
                            Team to utilize social media to provide students with easy access to timely and relevant information regarding the university’s ongoing student development programs, from academic coaching to career advice. Everyone on the committee is friendly
                            and you can contact any of us for questions. Feel free to contact me regarding any issues you have or for general advice. I’ll be more than happy to assist you. I look forward to seeing you at the University of Birmingham and wish you a great
                            time and the best of luck in all your endeavours.

                            Hi there my name is Mohammed Ateeq and I'm the head of Socials at UBISOC. And I'm a second year Chemical Engineering Student.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of the year the Islamic Society organises a number of events and social gatherings in order to provide people with a sense of togetherness and unity while not compromising on our religious values. As the Head of Socials it is my responsibility
                            to plan out events with input from other Socials Officers and the committee as a whole. I am also responsible for ensuring that the events provided are fun and exciting to our members and also provide new and exciting socials for people to
                            get stuck in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have any questions about myself, my role or general queries don't hesitate to contact me with the details provided. All committee members are always happy to help and I'm no exception.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the social officer along with Mohammed Ateeq i am in charge of organising and controlling events and amazing social experiences for the muslim students on campus. I believe everyones time at university should be a time they can remember for having the best expereinces in thier life with freinds they can keep forever. So my job is to make that come true so that you can enjoy and love your time while you learn. And most importantly it is our aim as a committee to provide halal and good social experiences as muslims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our committee is generally very open and welcoming so you are encouraged to speak to anyone but if you’d like to speak to me, I’m more than happy to offer whatever help I can. I look forward to speaking to you and I hope you have a great time at the University of Birmingham and with the Islamic Society!

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two positions in this role. One for brothers and one for sisters. The two are in charge of planning and organising the Islamic talks throughout the academic year. It is quite evident that many students face trials religiously in university, which we as an ISOC try to provide assistance in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, we see what topics people are interested in and would like to understand and know more about. We cater for this as well. This can be done by either through a series of lectures or small more concise circles (halaqas).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being on the committee is very rewarding. From the good work you do, to the great bonds you make. The diversity of Muslims in university takes you through a walk of understanding. Opening the mind and popping the bubble. In’sha’Allah we will meet soon.

                            Hi there I'm Rayhan Ahmed and I am one of the community officers for the Islamic Society for 2017/2018. I am a second year psychology student.

                        <p>
                            As a community officer my role is to organise various events that wish to serve the local community with examples being 'Feeding the Homeless' campaign and 'Giving Blood' campaign. It's not limited to this and we intend to have various different ways in which the Islamic Society can give back to the community it is a part of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We feel it is important to keep the spirit of 'giving back' alive. A recent success was the 2017 Ramadan project where a group of us were able to organise and run iftar for every night of Ramadan, for the students at UoB. This also included a wide spread community iftar which brought together various different people of different backgrounds to enjoy each other's company and have some good food together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We hope to have various other events which give you the chance to give something back to society in some way. If you have anymore questions or queries you can contact any of the committee members or myself personally.
